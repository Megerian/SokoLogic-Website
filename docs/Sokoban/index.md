Sokoban is a puzzle video game in which the player pushes boxes around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations.

The game was designed in 1981 by Hiroyuki Imabayashi, and first published in December 1982. The original game of SOKOBAN was written by Hiroyuki Imabayashi.

Today Sokoban is one of the most popular thought and logic games.

The name comes from Japan and means "warehouse keeper".

As simple as that name is, so is the idea of this game:

A Sokoban puzzle represents a store room, where boxes appear to be randomly placed. You help the warehouse keeper to push the boxes around the maze of the room so that, at the end, all boxes are on marked fields.

The only restrictions are that the warehouse keeper can only push a box, never pull, and that just one box may be pushed at a time.

Each puzzle has a different structure, which requires a different solution - often with a different strategy as well. The magic of the game is that boxes, which are out of the way on one move, might be in the way on the next move.

The simplicity of the rules, in combination with the many puzzles ranging from easy to extremely difficult, have made Sokoban become a real classic.
