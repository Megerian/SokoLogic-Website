# üß† Game Concept

Sokoban is a puzzle video game in which the player pushes boxes around in a warehouse, trying to get them to storage locations.

The game was designed in 1981 by **Hiroyuki Imabayashi** and first published in December 1982.  
Today, Sokoban is one of the most popular thought and logic games in the world.

The name comes from Japan and means *‚Äúwarehouse keeper.‚Äù*

A Sokoban puzzle represents a storeroom where boxes are placed in a maze.  
You help the warehouse keeper to **push boxes** so that, at the end, all boxes are on marked goal fields.

- You can **push**, but not pull.
- You can push only **one box at a time**.
- Each puzzle has a unique structure that requires a specific strategy.

The simplicity of the rules combined with the variety of puzzles has made Sokoban a true classic.
